Problem Statement: E-commerce Application Development
1. Introduction
In the rapidly evolving digital commerce landscape,
an efficient and scalable e-commerce platform is essential for seamless online transactions.
The goal of this project is to develop an E-commerce Application from scratch using Spring Boot and Java,
ensuring robust functionalities for managing shopping cart, orders, coupons, addresses, and billing details.


The system will leverage a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL/any in memory DB) for storing critical transactional data
and Redis for caching frequently accessed data to enhance performance. The developed solution will be scalable, optimized,
and production-ready with a well-defined architecture and flow diagrams for better understanding.


2. Scope of the Project
The E-commerce Application will include the following core functionalities:


A. User Cart Management (mandatory)
- Add items to the cart
- Remove items from the cart
- Update item quantity in the cart


System Features
- Use Redis for caching cart data and active coupons
- Store user, order, and product information in a relational database
- Develop REST APIs for all major functionalities
- Implement exception handling, logging, and security best practices


3. Technology Stack
Component - Technology Used;
Backend - Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA;
Database - PostgreSQL / MySQL;
Caching -  Redis;
Build Tool - Maven or Gradle;
API Testing - Postman or any Clinet tool;
Version Control - Git & GitHub;


4. Implementation Plan
- Clone repo and create branch with name and write and push code in that branch ONLY.
- Design Database Schema for Users, Cart, Orders, Coupons, and Billing Details
- Develop REST APIs for cart, orders, and other functionalities
- Integrate Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Write JUnit
- Develop Flow Diagrams to explain the system flow
- Push Code to GitHub for collaboration and deployment


5. Expected Deliverables
- A well-structured Spring Boot application
- A functional e-commerce backend with REST APIs
- Database schema for efficient storage
- Optimised caching strategy using Redis
- Well-documented API endpoints following proper REST standards
- Code hosted on GitHub - You need to push code on shared repositories.
